### Project Details
This project is a simple web app designed to let a user book a one-way flight. It showcases knowledge of advanced form concepts in Rails such as nested forms. It also utilizes MVC concepts and ActiveRecord.

**Search For Flight:** Users are given a search menu page with 4 dropdown menus to search for a flight based on the departure airport, arrival airport, departure date, and amount of passengers. Associations are set up between the Airport and Flight models. Database is seeded with airports and flights. 

**Book A Flight:** Users submit the search form and are given a new form with a set of available flights via querying. Users select a given flight and move on to the next step. 

**Enter Passenger Information:** A new form is produced for the user to enter their details in and submit as a Booking object. Passenger objects will be created along with the Booking for each Passenger who needs a ticket. Associations set up between Bookings, Passengers and Flights. 

**(Bonus) Styling:** Styling is not required as this project is primarily for practice with the backend, however I will be using vanilla CSS to add some visuals to the app.
